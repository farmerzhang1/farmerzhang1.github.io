## About me
Hi, I'm farmerzhang1, a CS student interested in Programming Languages and Formal Methods. For me, functional programming reveals the connection between programming and mathematics, and with formal methods we can prove a system is correct instead of testing bugs.

I'm also a dance lover (classical ballet and modern/contemporary dance in particular) and an amateur dancer myself. One of my favorite classical ballet is *Giselle*, neoclassical *Dances at a gathering* by Jerome Robbins, contemporary ones I need to watch more.
